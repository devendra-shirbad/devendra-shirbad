Hello,

Don't get caught up between the terms Relational or Non-Relational, SQL or NoSQL, On-Premise or Cloud, LatestBuzzWord. If the database doesn't fulfill business needs it's useless.

I invite you to discuss your database problems with me. 

Please visit [devendrashirbad.in](http://devendrashirbad.in/) and schedule a [30 min] One-on-One. It's FREE.

Thanks,
